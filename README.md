# Animated Search box with @Hackway

This code creates a search form with a search input field and a submit button. When the user submits the form, the code hides the search image and displays the search results for the query entered in the search input field.

## Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

1) The searchForm variable is used to reference the search form element.
2) The search input variable is used to reference the search input field element.
3) The search image variable is used to reference the search image element.
4) The search results variable is used to reference the search results element.
5) The searchForm event listener is used to handle the submit event of the search form.
6) The preventDefault() method is used to prevent the default action of the submit event, which is to submit the form.
7) The searchImage.style.display = "none" statement is used to hide the search image.
8) The search results.innerHTML =Showing results for: ${searchInput.value}; statement is used to display the search results for the query entered in the search input field.


I hope this summary is helpful. Let me know if you have any other questions.
